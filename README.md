## Gameplay

Move around the map with 4 keys `W = up` `S = down` `A = left` `D = right` and collecting all bouncing collectibles.
An exit gate will appear once all collectibles have been collected, escape through it to win the game.
<br /><br />
You'll lose if coming into collision with enemies, although attacking animation indeed looks like 
it can slay a foe. Don't flatter yourself :zany_face:
